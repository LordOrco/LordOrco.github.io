                        I started programming when I was in high school because I had always loved video games and wanted to try making them on my own. This led me to create a Minesweeper game and a <i>Snake Game</i> with console graphics in Python. However, it was throughout my degree in <b>Video Game Design and Development</b> that I learned most of the programming fundamentals I know today. In recent years, I've learned many programming languages, from Assembly and C# to HTML, Octave, and Java. However, I recognize that learning never stops, and there is always more to discover. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. These projects not only helped me strengthen my <b>technical skills</b> but also taught me how to solve complex problems and think more creatively, as well as develop strong <b>communication</b> and <b>team organization</b> skills. As I continue to develop my knowledge, some of the most recent aspects I have learned are reflected in the games I present below, each representing an important part of my <b>evolution</b> as a programmer and video game developer.
