                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">During my studies, I collaborated with an incredible team, where I took on roles that allowed me to bridge communication across diverse fields such as programming, sound design, and 3D modeling. This collaboration honed my skills in coding while fostering an adaptable mindset essential for game development.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">Along the way, I deepened my understanding of programming languages and tools, including <b>Unity (C#), Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, pushing myself to design more complex mechanics and systems. My projects have also led me to independently create games, where I developed core programming while my sister contributed 2D art.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0" style="text-align: justify;">Through these experiences, I have gained solid skills in code architecture, multiplayer networking, and interactive mechanics. My goal is to continue enhancing my expertise and build larger-scale, impactful projects.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"> We're facing a post-apocalyptic environment in southern Spain. There is a decline in human population and the environment changes as irrigation systems stop working; going back to its natural steppe form. Maybe even more desert-like due to the rise in temperature in the world left by the society of yesteryear.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"> However, in more northern areas of Europe, the vegetation gains strength and invades the buildings of the past civilization.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"> As so, we create different thumbnails representing Spain  in this case; as it is Mia's birthplace. We generate 4 different environments: the outskirts of a city, a Spanish forest of melojos and cork oaks (typical trees that give that dry feeling), some wheat fields and the interior of a city.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"> And so, we end up choosing the most descriptive Spanish environment: the wheat fields; specially as the abandoned tank hints to what could've happened in the past.</p>
